      <p> In 2040 BS, the classes at Kankali Secondary School were first held outside between a cottage and a temple
        called Kankali Devi. When it rained or was too hot,
        students would seek refuge in the hut and the abandoned temple.It is based on local public schools and is
        present
        in Kathmandu Valley's first fourth place of schools,
        signifying the proclaimed studies of computer engineering.It is located in Kathmandu's Chandragiri
        municipality's
        Purano Naikap Ward 13. It is situated at a 1565 meter
        elevation above sea level.
        This school was in a pleasant setting, surrounded by a lush forest. The social workers Mr. Ganesh Bahadur Basnet
        and Mr. BabuKaji Basnet made a significant
        contribution by opening their home as a temporary classroom for the students. With the financial assistance of
        Plan International Nepal, we were able to construct
        a tiny structure with four rooms after five years of nonstop work and suffering. Social workers, peasants,
        political leaders,
        and other participants all made significant and unselfish contributions. Their assistance will always be
        remembered as a turning point for the school.<br>
        Since there were scarcely any kids at the school in the start, the principal was under severe stress. The
        school's
        physical layout was in very poor shape.
        In actuality, there were no physical amenities at all at that time.
        Nearby a deserted temple, where students formerly studied while seated on a straw-made tiny mat called a sukul,
        was a modest hut to shield them from the rain and sun.<br>
        The youngest sister of the goddess Dakshinkali, goddess Kankali, is the inspiration for the school's name, which
        has significant religious significance.
        According to the people, goddess Kankali is believed to have always protected this school as a divine power,
        holding it in her arms.Since this school was founded,
        it has played a significant role in educating and supplying information to the locals as well as other villages
        including Syuchatar, Balambu, Satungal, and Dahachowk.
        The area where Kankali School is located is one of the greatest examples of multi-cultural,
        multi-ethnic cultures, and students at the school include Brahmins, Chhetris, Lamas, Tamangs, and others who
        practice Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism.
